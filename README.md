# HMJS

**WARNING: THIS REPO IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED. However, it still may be useful for inspiration for similar projects. Feel free to fork.**

HMJS is a simple view component/encapsulation template rendering library, powered by [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js). 
You can think of it as a jQuery plugin for Mustache. HMJS can issue callbacks (within scope of component), 
when the template has rendered, and when your view logic (viewmodel) has run. This easily allows your view components to be kept
modular/encapsulated, and each view/component can have its own API. Emphasis was placed on performance, so it's great for
HTML5 mobile apps, or where performance is crucial.

## Example Usage:

_welcome.mustache_
```HTML
<div data-tplid="{{tplid}}">
<button><span>Hello</span>, {{name}}!</button>
</div>
```
_welcome.js_
```JS
window.welcome = function($scope, data){

    var status = false;
    
    function toggle(){
        status = !status;
        $scope.find('button span').html(status ? 'Bye' : 'Hello');
    }
    
    $scope.on('click', 'button', toggle);
    
    /* return api */
    return {
      toggle: toggle
    };
   
};
```
_app.js_
```JS
$('body').insertView('welcome', {name: 'Dave'}, function(data, vm){
    vm.toggle(); //call 'toggle' directly from welcome's api when component is ready
});
```

## Benefits

- Componentize your views!
- Very few depedencies. Comes with everything you need except jQuery.
- Callbacks when component and DOM node are ready.
- Ability to easily manipulate or tear down views.
- jQuery plugin
- Super fast performance
- Very small file size

## Installation

## Wait, what is a viewmodel?

There are many definitions for [viewmodel](https://www.infoq.com/articles/View-Model-Definition). For our purposes,
a **_viewmodel_** is a wrapper or decorator that ideally contains all of the javascript logic required for the view/component.
This could be event binding, data binding, callbacks, template manipulation, etc. HMJS does not have any opinions
on how this is implemented, and it is left to you. Feel free to bring your own data-binding library.

## Why are we doing this? Who is this for?

HMJS was originally written to be used as a way to organize and encapsulate view components in a HTML5 mobile app.
Performance and small filesize were key goals. Mustache is also ubiquitous, [well documented](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html), simple, 'logicless', 
[highly portable](https://mustache.github.io/) (it's available in many languages), and one of the fastest JS template engines.
Mustache templates are usually clean and easy-to-read, yet highly flexible (see lambda functions). HMJS is great for 
use in micro-library frameworks, custom frameworks, or as components within other frameworks.
